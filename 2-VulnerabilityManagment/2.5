Explain concepts related to vulnerability response, handling, and management.

• Compensating control: Type of control that acts as substitute for a principle control

• Control types
  - Managerial: Provides oversight of the systems (Tools like vuln scans to see the network)
  - Operational: Adding people insead of system (Guards for a building)
  - Technical: Installing something to a system (Software, Hardware, Firmware)
(Functional Types)  
  - Preventative: Adding measures to prevent something from happening (Firewall)
  - Detective: Being able to go back and see what happened (Logs, Network traffic, video cameras, etc.)
  - Corrective: Act as a way to reduce the impact of something (Offsite backup or patch managment system)
  - Responsive: Actively monitors and trys to stop things from happening (IDS, IPS, Firewalls, etc.)

• Patching and configuration management
  - Testing
  - Implementation
  - Rollback
  - Validation

• Maintenance windows

• Exceptions

• Risk management principles
  - Accept
  - Transfer
  - Avoid
  - Mitigate

• Policies, governance, and service-level objectives (SLOs)

• Prioritization and escalation

• Attack surface management
  - Edge discovery
  - Passive discovery
  - Security controls testing
  - Penetration testing and adversary emulation
  - Bug bounty
  - Attack surface reduction

• Secure coding best practices
  - Input validation
  - Output encoding
  - Session management
  - Authentication
  - Data protection
  - Parameterized queries

• Secure software development life cycle (SDLC)

• Threat modeling
