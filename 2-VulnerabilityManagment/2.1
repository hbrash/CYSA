Given a scenario, implement vulnerability scanning methods and concepts.

• Asset discovery
  - Map scans
  - Device fingerprinting

• Special considerations
  - Scheduling
  - Operations
  - Performance
  - Sensitivity levels
  - Segmentation
  - Regulatory requirements

• Internal vs. external scanning

• Agent vs. agentless

• Credentialed vs. non-credentialed

• Passive vs. active

• Static vs. dynamic
  - Reverse engineering
  - Fuzzing

• Critical infrastructure
  - Operational technology (OT)
  - Industrial control systems (ICS)
  - Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)

• Security baseline scanning

• Industry frameworks
  - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
  - Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks
  - Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
  - International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27000 series
